            <h3>THE JUNGLE</h3>
            <p>The jungle consists of the parts of the map between the lanes proper, excluding the teams' bases, characterized by the lack of vision or dense Fog of War. Neutral—not aggressive unless attacked—creeps called monsters live in the jungle, and a monster or group of monsters at a certain location of the map is called a camp. Jungling encompasses three specialized responsibilities of the jungler. These contrast with laners', whose primary purpose is to farm minions and defend their lane's structures in the earlier stages of the game. Farming the jungle, meaning the slaying of monster camps. Having access to the Smite summoner spell in order to secure epic monster objectives, which are beneficial to the entire ally team. And lastly, because of the jungle's extent, generally assisting and influencing lanes.</p>

                <h3>BLUE SENTINEL</h3>
                <p>The Blue Sentinel is a neutral monster on Summoner's Rift. Killing the Blue Sentinel grants the Crest of Insight, a buff which grants increased mana regeneration (or energy regeneration) as well as ability haste. When the map transforms into the Elemental Rift, the Blue Sentinel becomes Draconic, gaining this form if alive and respawning in it each time. Killing it in this form leaves behind a buff wisp at the camp's location for 60 seconds. The wisp can be picked up by an allied champion moving near it, granting them the Crest of Insight buff. Once the Baron Nashor spawns at 20:00, the Blue Sentinel becomes permanently corrupted by the Void if it is not Draconic, transforming into a Voidborn with 30% increased health. Killing it in this form grants you and all your allied champions, if alive, the Crest of Insight buff. Any remaining Draconic Blue Sentinels that are slain respawn as Voidborn instead.</p>

Killing the Red Brambleback grants the Crest of Cinders, a buff which grants health regeneration out of combat and causes basic attacks to apply a slow and a burn that deals true damage over time. When the map transforms into the Elemental Rift, the Red Brambleback becomes Draconic, gaining this form if alive and respawning in it each time. Killing it in this form leaves behind a buff wisp at the camp's location for 60 seconds. The wisp can be picked up by an allied champion moving near it, granting them the Crest of Cinders buff. Once the Baron Nashor spawns at 20:00, the Red Brambleback becomes permanently corrupted by the Void if it is not Draconic, transforming into a Voidborn with 30% increased health.

                <h3>BARON PIT</h3>
                <p>The baron pit is one of the game's most unique jungle camps on Summoner's Rift. The occupants serve as a neutral objective that is meant to rival the importance of camps that appear in the dragon pit. The camps spawned in the baron pit are static throughout a game of League of Legends. One of three epic monster camps may occupy the baron pit at any one time and in this order: The Voidgrubs; The Rift Herald; One Baron Nashor type out of three</p>

            <h3>VOID GRUBS</h3>
            <p>The Voidgrub and Voidmite are neutral monsters on Summoner's Rift. Their camp is located in the baron pit. The Voidgrub camp consists of three epic Voidgrubs. Every 12 seconds in combat, each Voidgrub will spawn a wave of four lesser Voidmites. Killing a Voidgrub awards gold and experience, as well as a stack of the Touch of the Void buff to all team members. Touch of the Void grants bonus damage over time to structures, and for each stack beyond the fourth, team members additionally gain the Hunger of the Void buff, which will summon allied Voidmites to assist in taking down enemy turrets.</p>

                <p>The Rift Herald is a powerful neutral monster in Summoner's Rift. It is located in the baron pit. Slaying the Rift Herald drops the Eye of the Herald at the entrance of the pit for 20 seconds, which can be picked up by one member of the slayer's team, and is used for summoning the Rift Herald Mercenary. Upon picking it up, the slayer's team also gains Glimpse of the Void. The Rift Herald only spawns once per game, and despawns permanently at 19:45, or 19:55 if in combat. Baron Nashor spawns in her place at 20:00.</p>

Killing Baron Nashor grants Hand of Baron to all living teammates for 180 seconds, which grants bonus attack damage, ability power, Empowered Recall, and an aura that greatly increases the power of nearby minions. Baron Nashor will spawn in one of three different forms for the remainer of the game, determined randomly: Hunting, Territorial, and All-Seeing. The Territorial and All-Seeing forms cause the terrain around the baron pit to permanently shift the former adds a small wall in front of the pit, while the latter creates a long tunnel laterally. Each form also has a special ability that occurs 6 attacks after using Acid Pool.</p>

                <h2>THE RIFT SCUTTLER</h2>
                <h3>SCUTTLE CRAB</h3>
                <p>The Rift Scuttler is a neutral monster on Summoner's Rift. There are two Rift Scuttlers on the map, one in the top half of the river and one in the bottom half of the river. The Rift Scuttler is unique amongst all monsters for two reasons: she will not retaliate against an attacker, instead attempting to flee directly away from them; and two, she continually moves along a fixed path in the river on the part of the map where she spawns. This makes Rift Scuttler the only non-hostile and autonomously moving monster on the map. Unlike other monsters, Rift Scuttlers spawn with one level below the average of all champions' levels (capped at level 1). At initial spawn, Rift Scuttlers will spawn in the top and bottom river. Both must be killed before the respawn timer activates. Once both initial Rift Scuttlers are killed, only one Rift Scuttler can be on the map at any given time for the rest of the game. Respawn locations are randomly determined, but signaled ahead of time with a respawn marker. After the Baron Nashor spawns at 20:00, all Rift Scuttlers become permanently corrupted by the Void, transforming into Voidborn with 30% increased health. Killing a Rift Scuttler in this form causes it to release an aura of void energy around itself over 1.5 seconds, granting sight of the surrounding area as it travels and revealing enemies in its path. Enemy champions are revealed for 3 seconds, while non-champions are revealed for 12 seconds. The reveal duration refreshes if they remain in the area where the energy is still spreading. Wards have their health reduced to 1. Once the energy has spread out completely, it continues to grant sight of the area for another 3 seconds.</p>

            <h3>BLAST CONE</h3>
            <p>Blast Cones are a type of plant with explosive fruit. Their explosive properties are powerful enough to fling a humanoid several meters away. It triggers an explosion that causes all units within a Range center 325 radius—including the attacker—to be displaced up to 900 units away. This can send units over terrain. All units are revealed during the displacement.</p>

Being a semi-aquatic plant, it can be seen on the shores of rivers, lakes, and other bodies of fresh water. It drops 5 fruits on the ground for 30 seconds. Champions moving over a fruit consume them to restore 6% maximum mana plus the greater amount between 3.5% maximum health and 14 - 116 (based on level) health, but are slowed by 35% for 0.25 seconds.</p>
