                <h3>VISION SCORE</h3>
                <p>Support players are responsible for vision and they usually have the most vision score. Vision Score is a stat that indicates how much vision a player has influenced in the game, including the vision they granted and denied. Vision score can be calculated as an estimate through the following: Vision Score = (1 point per minute of ward lifetime provided) + (1 point per minute of ward lifetime denied).</p>
