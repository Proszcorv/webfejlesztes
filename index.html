            <h2>WHAT IS LEAGUE OF LEGENDS?</h2>
            <p>League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other's base. Choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory. It was published in 2009 by the gaming company called RIOT games and it is also the most watched esport game of all time!</p>

            <h2>STRUCTURES</h2>
            <h3>NEXUS</h3>
            <p>The Nexus is the heart of both teams bases. Destroy the enemy's Nexus first to win the game.</p>

            <div class="reverse">
                <h3>TURRETS</h3>
                <p>Turrets deal damage to enemy minions and champions, and provide limited vision from the Fog of War for their team. Attack these structures with minions ahead of you to avoid damage and charge ahead.</p>
                <figure class="round">

            </div>
            <h3>INHIBITORS</h3>
            <p>Each Inhibitor is protected by a Turret. When destroyed, super minions will spawn in that lane for several minutes. Afterward, the Inhibitor will respawn and Super Minions will stop spawning.</p>

            <h2>Roles</h2>
            <div class="reverse">
                <h3  id="fighters">FIGHTERS</h3>
                <p>Fighters (also known as Bruisers) are a diverse group of short-ranged combatants who excel at both dealing and surviving damage. With easy access to heavy, continuous damage (or DPS) and a host of innate defenses, fighters thrive in extended fights as they seek out enemies to take down, but their limited range puts them at constant risk of being kept at bay (or kited) by their opponents via crowd control, range and mobility.</p>
                <figure class="role_home">
                    <img src="media/fighters.jpg" alt="fighters">
                </figure>
            </div>
            <h3 id="tanks" >TANKS</h3>
            <p>Tanks are tough melee champions who sacrifice damage in exchange for powerful crowd control. While able to engage enemies in combat, a tank's purpose isn't usually to kill opponents; rather, tanks excel at disrupting enemies and diverting focus to themselves, allowing them to lock down specific targets (or several targets at once), as well as remove (or peel) threats from their allies.</p>
            <figure class="role_home">
                <img src="media/tanks.jpg" alt="tanks">
            </figure>
            <div class="reverse">
                <h3 id="mages">MAGES</h3>
                <p>Mages are champions who typically possess great reach, ability-based area of effect damage and crowd control, and who use all of these strengths in tandem with each other to trap and destroy enemies from a distance. Specializing in magic damage, often burst damage, and therefore investing heavily in items that allow them to cast stronger and faster spells, mages excel at chaining their abilities together in powerful combos in order to win fights, though their abilities also tend to be difficult to land and can be mitigated, if not avoided completely, by their targets if they react in time.</p>
                <figure class="role_home">
                    <img src="media/mages.jpg" alt="mages">
                </figure>
            </div>
            <h3 id="marksmen">MARKSMEN</h3>
            <p>Marksmen are ranged champions whose power almost exclusively revolves around their basic attacks: using their reach to land massive continuous damage from a distance, marksmen are capable of taking down even the toughest of opponents when positioned behind the safety of their team, and excel at securing map objectives such as Dragon, Baron Nashor and turrets.</p>
            <figure class="role_home">
                <img src="media/marksmen.jpg" alt="marksmen">
            </figure>
            <div class="reverse">
                <h3 id="supports">SUPPORTS</h3>
                <p>Controllers assist their allies with potent utility and keep enemies at bay with crowd control. Weak when alone, supports are capable of massively amplifying their teammates' power to become the strongest class in group combat (or teamfights), supplying crucial utility or crowd control at clutch moments to save allies from death and enable takedowns on the enemy</p>
                <figure class="role_home">
                    <img src="media/supports.jpg" alt="supports">
                </figure>
            </div>
            <h3 id="assassins">ASSASSINS</h3>
            <p>Slayers are highly mobile champions who specialize in single target burst damage. What they generally lack in resilience, they more than make up for with their ability to quickly cover large distances, kill priority targets and retreat just as fast. Epitomizing a high risk, high reward playstyle, assassins are natural opportunists and prefer to strike when their targets are alone and vulnerable, rather than engage them in a direct assault, favoring damage-oriented item builds to capitalize on their offensive capabilities.</p>
            <figure class="role_home">

            <h2>Gamemodes on Summoners Rift</h2>
            <div class="reverse">
                <h3>NORMAL</h3>
                <p>This mode emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and skill as players choose from a vast roster of champions, each with unique abilities, to secure objectives and ultimately destroy the enemy's Nexus. Unlike ranked games, normal matches are less intense and are often used for practice, experimentation, or casual play. Players can queue solo or with friends, and the games are matched based on skill levels to ensure balanced competition. Normal mode offers a flexible and accessible way to enjoy LoL without the pressure of climbing the competitive ladder.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img  class="non_round" src="media/normal.jpg" alt="heroes_splash">

            </div>
            <h3>RANKED</h3>
            <p>Ranked mode in League of Legends is the competitive version of the game, where players aim to climb through a structured tiered system by winning matches. The system is divided into nine tiers: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger, each with subdivisions (e.g., Gold IV to Gold I). Players earn or lose League Points (LP) based on match outcomes, with LP gains influenced by their matchmaking rating (MMR). Reaching 100 LP in a division promotes you to the next division, while falling to 0 LP and losing repeatedly risks demotion. Ranked mode is a test of consistency, skill, and teamwork, rewarding players with end-season rewards based on their final rank.</p>
